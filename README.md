Fix a function that should return the middle list element. In case of list having even number of elements the left middle element should be returned, e.g. ```[1,2,3,4]``` should return `2`
Include algorithm explanation

### Bug
Test discovered that each scenario returns element on index higher by one ex. expected should be `Some(2)` and actual is `Some(3)`
